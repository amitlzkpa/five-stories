In the first millennium, roughly 1,500 years ago, a pair of jackals began travelling around the world. They were known in India as Karataka and Damanaka, and they were the stars of one of the fabulous animal stories in a vast collection known as the Panchatantra.

Carried to Iran by the Persian physician Borzuya, the jackals became Kalilag and Dimnag. The stories flowed from Pahlavi into Arabic, where they remain Kalila and Dimna, from Arabic into Syriac, and from Syriac, many centuries later, into German. In the 8th Century, the jackals – one wily and cunning, one noble and upright – found their way into Old Castilian, where Europe embraced Calila and Dimna.

Talking about the Panchatantra in her book, Political Violence in Ancient India, the historian Upinder Singh pointed out that the tales are violent, the talking animals constantly offering advice on how to kill or not be killed. “The emphasis is on the need for effort, intelligence, cunning, and – above all – solid good sense to survive in a difficult world,” she writes.

The fable forest has troubles, and pitfalls, and old wells and rivers that contain lions and crocodiles. Stories tumble out everywhere you look, teaching you how to stay alive in the jungle, whom to make friends with, how to survive, and sometimes, how to be good and generous while you do all of this.

The tales from the Panchatantra, intended to teach princes statecraft, strategy, the pleasures and perils of friendships, moral conduct and lessons in power, had spread all around the world. They spread through a colourful network of pilgrims, court emissaries, Crusaders, monks, scholars, soldiers, diplomats, traders and assorted travellers across the world.

Most scholars agree that the earliest collected Panchatantra – the original Sanskrit, now lost, has been reconstructed from other translations – was probably compiled by an octogenarian Brahmin named Vishnu Sharma in Kashmir, roughly between 350-400 CE. Another version, translated by Durgasimha into the Indian language Kannada in roughly 1025 CE, travelled across Asia. Since then, the Panchatantra has had more than 200 retellings in at least 50 non-Indian languages.
